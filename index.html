    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>		
        The mission and vision of the Center to Stream Healthcare In Place (C2SHIP)
		is to engage academic and industrial partners in joint efforts to promote in-home healthcare technologies that allow people 
		to manage chronic diseases in their own homes.
		C2SHIP also seeks to accelerate innovation, multidisciplinary collaborations, and resource sharing, as well as prepare 
		a workforce able to promote wellness through self-care technologies.
		C2SHIP involves strong partnerships with some of the leading academic institutions, including Caltech, University 
		of Southern California, University of Arizona, Baylor School of Medicine, University of Missouri, and University of North Dakota.
		Additionally, C2SHIP has 21 industrial partners, further enhancing the capacity to drive meaningful change in the field of 
		in-home healthcare technologies. 
		Together, we are all committed to making a significant and positive impact to revolutionaze the way chronic diseases are managed
		and treated.<br>
		For more information about C2SHIP please visit the website
        <a target="_blank" href="https://c2ship.org">C2SHIP.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
		The C2SHIP Student and Trainee Organization (C2SHIP-STO) is dedicated to fostering connections and networking opportunities for undergraduate 
		and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and research assistants.
		Our primary objective is to facilitate meaningful interactions between these aspiring professionals and esteemed figures in academia,
		industry, and federal agencies such as FDA, NIH, and NSF. <br>
		As part of the C2SHIP annual meeting, C2SHIP-STO is organizing a compelling poster session, providing a platform for students and
		trainees to showcase their research and project ideas to academic professors, industrial members,
		and representatives from federal agencies. This unique opportunity allows researchers to present their work in diverse fields like
		healthcare, engineering, cyber-security, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, all of which align with C2SHIP's mission.

	<h1>Call for Abstracts</h1>

	<h2>Topics</h2>
		In this annual meeting, we invite the researchers to <a title="Register for the Conference" href="registration">submit the abstract </a> around the following topic areas:

		
	
		<li> Design wearable sensors/manufacturing </li>
		<li> Machine learning/artificial intelligence </li>
		<li> Data streaming and processing </li>
		<li> Cyber security/feedback </li>
		<li> Education and societal impact of in-place technologies</li>
		<li> Mathematical modeling of medical data </li>
		<li> Image processing and computer vision </li>
		<li> Other </li>
	
		
	
	Note: If the research idea does not fall under any of the above topics but follows the principle of streaming healthcare
	in place please submit them under “Other”.
	
	<h2>Important dates</h2>
	
	
		
		<li>Abstract Submission Deadline:<strong> September 10, 2023 </strong></li>
		<li>Abstract Acceptance Notification: <strong> September 20, 2023 </strong></li>
		<li>Poster Presentation Dates: <strong> October 26 and 27, 2023 at USC Capital Campus, Washington DC </strong> </li>
		
	
	
	<h2> Best Poster Award</h2>
		The Best Poster Award recognizes the the most accomplished three poster presentations at the C2SHIP Annual Meeting.
		A poster committee comprised of academic and industrial members evaluates all posters on their design, clarity of the presentation 
		(both of the poster and while presenting), and scientific content. <br>
		 <strong> The three best poster presentations will be awarded with certificates and prize money. </strong> 


	
	<h2>Social Dinner</h2>
	 A social dinner will be offered during the annual meeting to provide a remarkable opportunity for students and trainees to foster meaningful connections
	 and networking with academic and industrial partners in an informal and relaxed setting.
