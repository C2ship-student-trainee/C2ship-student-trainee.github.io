    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>		
        The mission and vision of the Center to Stream Healthcare In Place(C2SHIP)
		is to engage academic and industrial partners in joint efforts to promote in-home healthcare technologies that allow people 
		to manage chronic diseases in their own homes.
		C2SHIP also seeks to accelerate innovation, multidisciplinary collaborations, and resource sharing, as well as prepare 
		a workforce able to promote wellness through self-care technologies.
		C2SHIP involves strong partnerships with some of the leading academic institutions, including Caltech, University 
		of Southern California, University of Arizona, Baylor School of Medicine, University of Missouri, and University of North-Dakota.
		Additionally, C2SHIP have 21 industrial partners, further enhancing the capacity to drive meaningful change in the field of 
		in-home healthcare technologies. 
		Together, we are all committed to making a significant and positive impact to revolutionaze the way chronic diseases are managed
		and treated.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
		C2SHIP student and trainee organization (C2SHIP-STO) is dedicated to fostering connections and networking opportunities for undergraduate 
		and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers and research assistants.
		Our primary objective is to facilitate meaningful interactions between these aspiring professionals and esteemed figures in academia,
		industry, and federal agencies such as FDA, NIH, and NSF. <br>
		As part of the C2SHIP annual meeting, C2SHIP-STO is organizing a compelling poster session, providing a platform for students and
		trainees to showcase their research and project ideas to academic professors, industrial members,
		and representatives from federal agencies. This unique opportunity allows researchers to present their work in diverse fields like
		healthcare, engineering, cyber-security, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, all of which align with C2SHIP's mission.
